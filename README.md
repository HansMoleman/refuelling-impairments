## 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; State of System

The following is a summary of the system's current state:

* system will fetch CPU usage data, print it to the display, and then sleep for _n_ seconds.
* system will also print the time offset at which a check occurs.
* system will write the time and value of CPU usage to a .csv data file each check.

In Progress:

## 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives

- [x] implement ability to monitor CPU usage every _n_ seconds on an infinite cycle
- [x] implement ability to record CPU usage as it monitors it on an infinite cycle
- [ ] implement ability to monitor and record RAM usage on a set interval
- [ ] implement ability to monitor and record disk read/write usage on a set interval
- [ ] give user ability to both run and stop system at will
- [ ] implement ability to produce graph of CPU usage
- [ ] implement ability to save image of CPU usage graph to disk

Algorithm for the main use case:

* user starts monitoring tool before loading sim session.
* system initializes.
* system begins monitoring target hardware/computer resources and records necessary data on a set interval until user interrupts it.
* user interrupts the system.
* system stops monitoring/recording.
* system reads back data it has recorded and uses it to create graphical plots representing it.
* system saves created plots as images and then deletes all recorded data.
* system exits.
